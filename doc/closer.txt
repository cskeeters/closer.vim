*closer.txt*    Plugin for closing open buffers

This plugin allows the user to close buffers quickly.  It opens another buffer
that lists each buffer that is open.  You can select the buffer you want to
close and press 'x'.  Once you have closed the buffers you desire, you can
press 'q' to close the closer buffer.

                                                *closer-mappings*
The following mapping is suggested:

nmap <silent> <localleader>c <Plug>OpenCloser
    Opens the closer window

                                                *closer-credit*
